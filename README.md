# Using VGG16 to Classify Spectrograms

## Introduction

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook titled using-vgg16-to-classify-spectrograms.ipynb, which demonstrates how to use the VGG16 model, a pre-trained deep learning model, to classify spectrograms. The notebook is designed to provide a practical example of applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the field of audio signal processing.
